# Lyrxer

An application specialized in presenting animated and customizable lyrics with a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interface. The UI/UX has been thoughtfully designed and tailored by me.

I developed this application with a specific goal in mind: I found the lyrics/text component of OBS Studio, particularly on Linux, to be reaaaaly subpar. It couldn't display real-time file changes and lacked extensive customization options (not to mention it can't even do simple customization like align the text), which was quite frustrating. Even though I am usually a very calm person, it realy made me upset so i took my tools and got to work.

## Getting Started

The project has only 6 days of life, and I'm nearly ready to release a build since it's a simple and small one.

For now, I'm focused on tailoring it for Linux, as it's the platform with the least support, and it's the one I work with, making it easier to test and debug during development.
